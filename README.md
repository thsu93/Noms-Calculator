# Noms-Calculator

A food diary that tracks meals and measures Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), using a modified version of NoahTren's NOMS library.


Future plans:
* Finish converting to GUI 
* Improved data dict structure for ease of manipulation/easier to read JSON output
* Allow for removal/editing of already input amounts of food
* Allow for importing of JSON files to rebuild
